# Project Overview

This Windows Forms application provides a straightforward interface for users to specify folders containing their movie and TV series collections. Users can easily browse and select their desired media files, which the application organizes for quick access. Additionally, the app features a built-in media player that allows users to watch their selected movies and series directly within the application. 

For added convenience, there is also an option to stream content through the web (**it does not work well at all**), enabling users to access their media library from anywhere with an internet connection. 

This application aims to enhance the user experience by providing a centralized hub for managing and enjoying their favorite films and shows.

# What to Expect

Projects like this was an integral part of my learnings in software development in general. This repository captures an important phase in my journey as a software developer. So you can expect the following:

### Code Quality:
The code here is a testament to my early programming skills. You may encounter numerous bugs, terrible inefficiencies, and less-than-ideal coding practices that were part of my learning curve.

### Learning Journey:
This project was more about the journey than the destination. It helped me understand the basics of software development and laid the foundation for the skills I have today.

### Nostalgia:
While this project may no longer be relevant, it’s a personal reminder of where I began. It’s a piece of my history that I keep as a benchmark of my progress as a software developer.

# Why This Project is Archived
This project is in an archived state and is no longer being actively maintained or updated. I’ve chosen to preserve it in its original form as a record of my growth as a developer. It’s a snapshot of a time when I was still finding my footing in the world of coding.

# Final Thoughts
I hope you find value in exploring this codebase, even if it’s just to see how far one can come from humble beginnings. And if you don't find value in this project I hope it brings a smile to your face as you find many.... many.... cringe worthy practices.

This project may be frozen in time, but the lessons I learned from it continue to influence my work today.
